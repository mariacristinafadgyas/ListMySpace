# List My Space

**ListMySpace** is an innovative platform that seamlessly connects property owners with potential buyers or tenants. This app serves as a direct marketplace where property owners can list their properties. This makes it easier for people all over the world to find their ideal home, commercial space or land. By simplifying this process, ListMySpace aims to make the search and purchase of real estate more accessible and efficient for everyone involved.<br>
<br>
Developed as a web application using Flask, ListMySpace offers robust features for efficient user and property management. Key features include user registration, login and JWT-based authentication to ensure secure access. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both users and properties, increasing the versatility of the application.<br>
<br>
The backend uses SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), providing a powerful and flexible database interaction layer. In addition, Flask-Migrate is used for seamless schema management, enabling easy database migrations and updates. This setup ensures that the application remains scalable and maintainable as it evolves.<br>
<br>
ListMySpace is not only about functionality, but also about creating an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The [application's interface](https://) is designed to be simple and accessible, helping users navigate the platform effortlessly .
